# Image-Classifier-AI-Application-Project
# Description:
Developing an AI application
Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, we might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, we will use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.
In this project, we'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells us the name of the flower our camera is looking at. In practice we will train this classifier, then export it for use in our application. We'll be using the dataset of 102 flower categories


The project is broken down into multiple steps:
Load and preprocess the image dataset
Train the image classifier on your dataset
Use the trained classifier to predict image content
When we've completed this project, we will have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. Here our network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application.

## NOTE: 
THE 'checkpoint.pth' file and the datasets were too large to upload.
